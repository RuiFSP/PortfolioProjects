# Project Showcase - HR Analytics - Build an HT dashboard using Power BI

## Project Overview
This project serves build an attractive and eye-catching HR dashboard using Power BI. We will begin this 
project by importing data & creating an employee demographics page that gives us the overall demographic 
outlook of the organization. We will then create pie charts and doughnut charts to visualize gender & racial diversity. 
In the final tasks, we will create an employee detail page that will provide you with all the important information 
about any employee with just a click. We will also explore buttons, themes, slicers & filters to make the dashboard 
more interactive & useful.
